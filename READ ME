Press LMB to spawn healthy cells.
Press RMB to spawn infected cells.
Press Middle Mouse Button to spawn walls.
To delete walls just press Middle Mouse Button while on them.
Press UPKEY to start keeping track of the data of the virus spread.
Once you'll close the simulation window, a plot will open showing the graph of the virus spread.
I suggest pressing KEYUP as soon as you start or finish spawning the infected cells.
